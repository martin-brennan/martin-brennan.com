I meant to make a post about this when I started, but I have now been working at [Discourse](https://discourse.org/) as a Software Engineer for six weeks!

The best things about working at Discourse are:

* The team (39 people and growing, largest I have ever worked on) is fully remote and distributed across every continent! (well, except Antarctica)
* Asynchronous work culture has been the core of the company since its inception. Discourse bleeds asynchronously!
* The team is full of [ridiculously talented people](https://www.discourse.org/team) who are generous with their knowledge. Everyone is a stellar written communicator.
* The codebase is fully open-source and is varied. On any day I can be working on the huge core product, a plugin, a theme component, or contributing to an open-source project Discourse uses.
* There is a _lot_ of reading and a _lot_ of writing, which is kind of a [thing of mine](https://writing.martin-brennan.com).
* Everyone is treated like grown-ups, and trusted to do their work on their own schedule.
* How much more time do you have? I can keep listing things!

I am over the moon with this job and still pinch myself each day when I think about where I work and who I work with. ðŸŒŸ
