A friend sent me this list of useful terminal shortcuts:

```
Ctrl-A: go to the beginning of line
Ctrl-E: go to the end of line
Alt-B: skip one word backward
Alt-F: skip one word forward
Ctrl-U: delete to the beginning of line
Ctrl-K: delete to the end of line
Alt-D: delete to the end of word
```

If you are using windows, I can't recommend [cmder](http://cmder.net/) enough. It is miles ahead of other terminals, and you can use bash, and Powershell inside it too.
