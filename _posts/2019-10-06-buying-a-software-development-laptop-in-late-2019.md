My new place of employment ([Discourse!](https://discourse.org)) purchases hardware for all employees, so I had a choice of laptop or desktop to buy. I went with a laptop because I want to be able to work from a co-working place or a cafe or library if I want to. This left me with a somewhat difficult choice to make, and in this article I will go over the different hardware I considered and what I eventually went ahead with. First off, the contenders.

### The Contenders

From my initial research several contenders came up:

* [Apple Macbook Pro 15](https://www.apple.com/au/macbook-pro/)
* [Dell XPS 15](https://www.dell.com/en-au/shop/laptops/new-15/spd/xps-15-7590-laptop)
* [System 76 Oryx Pro](https://system76.com/laptops/oryx)
* [Lenovo X1 Carbon](https://www.lenovo.com/au/en/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpad-x/ThinkPad-X1-Carbon-6th-Gen/p/22TP2TXX16G)
* [Razer Blade 15](https://www2.razer.com/au-en/gaming-systems/razer-blade)

### What I Want

The following are my must haves:

* A machine that can run Ubuntu, which I use now for all development
* 16GB of RAM
* A keyboard that is nice to type on, since typing is my job. I like to use a mechanical external keyboard, so something comparable would be nice
* Reliability

And my nice to haves:

* A 4K screen
* 32GB of RAM
* A good trackpad, as opposed to a middling or terrible one
* ＡＥＳＴＨＥＴＩＣＳ

#### System76 Oryx Pro

I like the looks of this laptop and the hardware, and apparently Linux works quite well on it. They have even built their own Linux distro based on Ubuntu, [PopOS](https://system76.com/pop). Unfortunately I've read a lot about build quality and hardware issues, which kind of scare me away from using it as a work laptop (or a personal laptop for that matter). The price also seems to be quite high for hardware comparable to other laptops. I want whatever I choose to be reliable and I cannot afford from a time _or_ money perspective to be waiting for days or weeks for hardware to be fixed, leaving me without a laptop in the meantime.

#### Lenovo X1 Carbon

Again this came highly reccommended, but _only_ if you do not intend to install Linux on the machine. I read cases where people bricked their X1 by installing Ubuntu, and it looked like there were several steps to getting an even halfway smooth experience, including disabling Secure Boot in the BIOS and fiddling around with other settings in there. Same issues apparently plague the X1 Extreme as well. I will not risk _bricking_ a laptop that is purchased for work.

### Razer Blade

I simply think this is overkill for a development laptop. I don't need to play games on it, I don't need some crazy GPU for that or any machine learning, and I certainly don't need RGB keys on the keyboard. More issues here with Linux as well. Apparently the battery life isn't all that great either, and they just seem to be so...expensive. Which I guess shouldn't matter that much for a laptop purchased by an employer, but if I don't feel like its a good deal I don't want someone else to shell out for it. I also found their website's ordering and specifications browsing experience to be quite confusing. Just doesn't seem to be what I'm looking for.

### Apple Macbook Pro 15

Like the Razor, this laptop is super expensive. Way more expensive that other laptops with comparative hardware. Sure the unibody construction is nice, and OSX is nice, and the trackpade is still the best in the game, but everyone has heard of the keyboard problems that has plagued this generation of MacBooks. Like the System76, there is no way I can spend significant amount of time without a laptop while it is getting repaired. In addition to the reliability issues with the keyboard, I went in and tried typing on one to see if the travel was as shallow as everyone claimed. It was like typing on a polished cement floor. And obviously, no Ubuntu here either. No thanks.

### Dell XPS 15

From what I read the XPS was always reccomended as the best value while still maintaining great build quality and comparable hardware specs to the other laptops mentioned here. I also would think that Dell, possibly naively, is a large company, and thus should have efficient customer service and repair systems in place if something does go wrong. Though from the reviews I read there doesn't seem to be anyone with hardware issues. Also it's nice that you can upgrade the RAM or SSD yourself. Everything from the screen, to the keyboard, to the trackpad and the body is well-reviewed. 

### Decision

I went with the Dell XPS 15. It fit the bill of a laptop where I could get a 4K screen and 32GB of RAM, which could run Ubuntu well without any issues. So far it has been good etc...
