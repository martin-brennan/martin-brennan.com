Over the next week or so I’m going to be blowing out the cobwebs of this blog so to speak, in a review, because I’ve been neglecting it quite a bit and I want it to be a better platform for my tech writing. I’m aiming to:

  * Rewrite the theme (again) for an easier to read and navigate blog, including the return of syntax highlighting. I’d previously converted about half of my code samples to use gists but I am going to go back to using a syntax highlighter (probably prism or highlight.js) to reduce load.
  * Go through old posts and put disclaimers on those that are old and probably no longer valid, or have misleading information. I may just implement a flag for posts to display this warning so  I don’t have to do it manually.
  * Speed up the performance of my site. If anyone has any tips on speeding up WordPress I’m all ears, I’ve tried to do a lot of things but they don’t seem to work for long. I may end up upgrading to a larger digitalocean droplet.

Apart from that, I aim to come up with more articles more frequently, a lot about JavaScript since that is what I’m primarily working with now. Thanks for reading, the changes will be coming soon.
