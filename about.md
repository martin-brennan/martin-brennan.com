I’m Martin Brennan, and I’m a full stack staff software engineer based in Australia, currently working for [Discourse](https://discourse.org). I primarily enjoy working with Ruby, Rails, and JavaScript, with a focus on product engineering. I’m always seeking ways to expand my knowledge and learn about new tools, languages and frameworks.

You can contact me via email at <a href="mailto:mjrbrennan@gmail.com">mjrbrennan@gmail.com</a>, or check out my GitHub profile {% include icon-github.html username="martin-brennan" %}.

When I'm not writing software I write fiction, and I have a writing site at <a href="https://writing.martin-brennan.com">https://writing.martin-brennan.com</a>. I also enjoy reading, music, gaming, getting outdoors, and spending time with my family and pets.
