I’m Martin Brennan, and I’m a full stack software engineer based in Australia. I primarily enjoy working with Ruby, Rails, C#, and JavaScript but I’m always seeking ways to expand my knowledge and learn about new tools, languages and frameworks.

You can contact me via email at <a href="mailto:martin_brennan@fastmail.com">martin_brennan@fastmail.com</a> or hit me up on twitter [@mjrbrennan](http://twitter.com/mjrbrennan)! You can also check out my GitHub profile {% include icon-github.html username="martin-brennan" %}, or my [StackOverflow profile](http://stackoverflow.com/users/875941/martin-brennan).

When I'm not writing software, I enjoy <a href="https://writing.martin-brennan.com">writing</a>, reading, music, cycling, hiking, and spending time with my family.
